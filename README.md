We want to know how a house buyer describes their dream house. Do they start with describing the neighborhood, the number of rooms, the number of cars in the garage, etc?! What are their preferences?! We also want to develop a model to predict the house prices based on the available preferences.

We will use a dataset of homes in Ames, Iowa to explores 79 variables and to build a prediction model using the train dataset. Then, the model will be used to predict the house prices in the test dataset.

The Ames Housing dataset was compiled by Dean De Cock for use in data science education.
