### Motivation
We want to know how a house buyer describes their dream house. Do they start with describing the neighborhood, the number of rooms, the number of cars in the garage, etc?! What are their preferences?! We also want to develop a model to predict the house prices based on the available preferences.

We will use a dataset of homes in Ames, Iowa to explores 79 variables and to build a prediction model using the train dataset. Then, the model will be used to predict the house prices in the test dataset.

This work was done as part of the Kaggle competition (House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques)

### Model Description
Missing LotFrontage data was imputed using KNN Gower distance.
Gradient Boosting Regressor trees were used to train and to build the model. The predicted prices got a Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error of 0.13426
as calculated by Kaggle.
